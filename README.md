  - Total rooms
  - Percentage of available and unavailable rooms
  - Total users and total members (agreed tenants)

## üé® Design & Styling

The application features a sleek and modern **dark theme** with a focus on usability and visual appeal:

- **Background:** A deep gradient (`bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-950 via-gray-900 to-indigo-950`) creates an immersive dark atmosphere.
- **Card/Paper Elements:** Semi-transparent dark gray (`bg-gray-800 bg-opacity-80 backdrop-blur-sm`) with subtle borders provides a "frosted glass" effect.
- **Primary Accent:** Various shades of **Indigo** (`text-indigo-400`, `bg-indigo-600`) are used for primary actions, titles, and interactive elements.
- **Secondary Accent:** **Pink** (`text-pink-400`, `bg-pink-500`) is used for decorative elements and highlights.
- **Text Colors:** A gradient of light grays (`text-gray-100` to `text-gray-500`) ensures readability across different components.
